# Configuration file for allow_hosts script by Leo
# Allowed hostnames
hostnames:
  emma: emma-mobil.kicks-ass.net
  erich: erich.homelinux.org
  flo: flobraeuer.dyndns.info

# Files to change
# The script looks after a BEGIN allowed_hosts ... END allowed_hosts block in each file
# For each entry in the hostnames section, the contents of the block will be replaced
#   by a comment and configuration line specified for each file. 
# The text has to be enclosed by double quotes. 
# The following variables can be used (using #{variable}):
#    ip
#    host
#    name
# After each line, a newline character is automatically inserted.
