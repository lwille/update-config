# Configuration file for allow_hosts script by Leo
# Allowed hostnames (can be dynamic DNS hosts)
hostnames:
  fred: fred.homelinux.org
  eric: eric.kicks-ass.net

# Files to change
# The script looks after a BEGIN allowed_hosts ... END allowed_hosts block in each file
# For each entry in the hostnames section, the contents of the block will be replaced
#   by a comment and configuration line specified for each file. 
# The text has to be enclosed by double quotes. 
# The following variables can be used (using #{variable}):
#    ip
#    host
#    name
# After each line, a newline character is inserted automatically.
